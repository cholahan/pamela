#### Visual Adaptations of Samuel Richardson\'s 1740 novel *Pamela*

This collection is comprised of two sets of engravings based on Samuel Richardson's 1740 novel, *Pamela*. The novel was first adapted as images by Joseph Highmore, who created a set of twelve paintings between 1741 and 1743. Highmore commissioned the French engravers Guillaume Philippe Benoist and Louis Truchy to produce engravings. This digital collection includes two editions of Benoist and Truchy's engravings, the x edition reproduced with permissions from the British Museum, and the 1762 edition reproduced with permissions from the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne.

This digital repository also includes eleven engravings \(of twelve), currently held at the University of Pennsylvania, printed in 1774 from  from unique plates based on Benoist and Truchy's engravings.
