Excerpt from Volume II

Said my master, Did you send your letter away to the posthouse, my good
girl, for your father?  To be sure, sir, said I, I did not forget that: I
took the liberty to desire Mr. Thomas to carry it.  What, said he, I
wonder, will the good old couple say to it?  O sir, said I, your goodness
will be a cordial to their dear honest hearts!  At that, my dear father,
not able to contain himself, nor yet to stir from the place, gushed out
into a flood of tears, which he, good soul! had been struggling with, it
seems; and cried out, O my dear child!

I knew the voice, and, lifting up my eyes, and seeing my father, gave a
spring, overturned the table, without regard to the company, and threw
myself at his feet: O my father! my father! said I, can it be?--Is it
you?  Yes, it is! it is!--O bless your happy daughter!  I would have
said, and down I sunk.

My master seemed concerned--I feared, said he, that the surprise would be
too much for her spirits; and all the ladies ran to me, and made me drink
a glass of water; and I found myself encircled in the arms of my dearest
father.--O tell me, said I, every thing!  How long have you been here?
When did you come?  How does my honoured mother?  And half a dozen
questions more, before he could answer one.

They permitted me to retire with my father; and then I poured forth all
my vows and thanksgivings to God for this additional blessing; and
confirmed all my master's goodness to his scarce-believing amazement.
And we kneeled together, blessing God, and one another, for several
ecstatic minutes and my master coming in soon after, my dear father said,
O sir, what a change is this!  May, God reward and bless you, both in
this world and the next!

May God bless us all! said he.  But how does my sweet girl?  I have been
in pain for you--I am sorry I did not apprise you beforehand.

O sir, said I, it was you; and all you do must be good--But this was a
blessing so unexpected!----

Well, said he, you have given pain to all the company.  They will be glad
to see you, when you can: for you have spoiled all their diversion; and
yet painfully delighted them at the same time.  Mr. Andrews, added he, do
you make this house your own; and the longer you stay, the more welcome
you'll be.  After you have a little composed yourself, my dear girl, step
in to us again.  I am glad to see you so well already.  And so he left
us.

See you, my dear father, said I, what goodness there is in this once
naughty master!  O pray for him! and pray for me, that I may deserve it!

How long has this happy change been wrought, my dear child?--O, said I,
several happy days!--I have written down every thing; and you'll see,
from the depth of misery, what God has done for your happy daughter!

Blessed be his name! said he.  But do you say he will marry you?  Can it
be, that such a brave gentleman will make a lady of the child of such a
poor man as I?  O the divine goodness!  How will your poor dear mother be
able to support these happy tidings?  I will set out to-morrow, to
acquaint her with them: for I am but half happy, till the dear good woman
shares them with me!--To be sure, my dear child, we ought to go into some
far country to hide ourselves, that we may not disgrace you by our
poverty!

O, my dear father, said I, now you are unkind for the first time!  Your
poverty has been my glory, and my riches; and I have nothing to brag of,
but that I ever thought it an honour, rather than a disgrace; because you
were always so honest, that your child might well boast of such a
parentage!

In this manner, my dear mother, did we pass the happy moments, till Miss
Darnford came to me, and said, How do you do, dear madam?  I rejoice to
see you so well!  Pray let us have your company.  And yours too, good Mr.
Andrews, taking his hand.
