Excerpt from Volume II

So I sat down in the window, all in a sad fluster; for, to be sure, I was
sadly frightened.--Said her woman, You should not sit in my lady's
presence, Mrs. Pamela.  Yes, let her sit till she is a little recovered
of her fright, said my lady, and do you set my chair by her.  And so she
sat over-against me, and said, To be sure, Pamela, you have been very
provoking with your tongue, to be sure you have, as well upon my nephew,
(who is a man of quality too,) as me.  And palliating her cruel usage,
and beginning, I suppose, to think herself she had carried it further
than she could answer it to her brother, she wanted to lay the fault upon
me.  Own, said she, you have been very saucy; and beg my pardon, and beg
Jackey's pardon, and I will try to pity you.  For you are a sweet girl,
after all; if you had but held out, and been honest.

'Tis injurious to me, madam, said I, to imagine I am not honest!--Said
she, Have you not been a-bed with my brother? tell me that.  Your
ladyship, replied I, asks your questions in a strange way, and in strange
words.

O! your delicacy is wounded, I suppose, by my plain questions!--This
niceness will soon leave you, wench: It will, indeed.  But answer me
directly.  Then your ladyship's next question, said I, will be, Am I
married?  And you won't bear my answer to that--and will beat me again.

I han't beat you yet; have I, Beck? said she.  So you want to make out a
story, do you?--But, indeed, I can't bear thou shouldst so much as think
thou art my sister.  I know the whole trick of it; and so, 'tis my
opinion, dost thou.  It is only thy little cunning, that it might look
like a cloak to thy yielding, and get better terms from him.  Pr'ythee,
pr'ythee, wench, thou seest I know the world a little;--almost as much at
thirty-two, as thou dost at sixteen.--Remember that!

I rose from the window, and walking to the other end of the room, Beat me
again, if you please, said I, but I must tell your ladyship, I scorn your
words, and am as much married as your ladyship!

At that she ran to me; but her woman interposed again: Let the vain
wicked creature go from your presence, madam, said she.  She is not
worthy to be in it.  She will but vex your ladyship.  Stand away, Beck,
said she.  That's an assertion that I would not take from my brother, I
can't bear it.  As much married as I!--Is that to be borne?  But if the
creature believes she is, madam, said her woman, she is to be as much
pitied for her credulity, as despised for her vanity.

I was in hopes to have slipt out at the door; but she caught hold of my
gown, and pulled me back.  Pray your ladyship, said I, don't kill me!--I
have done no harm.--But she locked the door, and put the key in her
pocket.  So, seeing Mrs. Jewkes before the window, I lifted up the sash,
and said, Mrs. Jewkes, I believe it would be best for the chariot to go
to your master, and let him know, that Lady Davers is here; and I cannot
leave her ladyship.

She was resolved to be displeased, let me say what I would.

Said she, No, no; he'll then think, that I make the creature my
companion, and know not how to part with her.  I thought your ladyship,
replied I, could not have taken exceptions at this message.  Thou knowest
nothing, wench, said she, of what belongs to people of condition: How
shouldst thou?  Nor, thought I, do I desire it, at this rate.

What shall I say, madam? said I.  Nothing at all, replied she; let him
expect his dearest love, and be disappointed; it is but adding a few more
hours, and he will make every one a day, in his amorous account.--Mrs.
Jewkes coming nearer me, and my lady walking about the room, being then
at the end, I whispered, Let Robert stay at the elms; I'll have a
struggle for't by and by.

As much married as I! repeated she.--The insolence of the creature!--And
so she walked about the room, talking to herself, to her woman, and now
and then to me; but seeing I could not please her, I thought I had better
be silent.  And then it was, Am I not worthy an answer?  If I speak, said
I, your ladyship is angry at me, though ever so respectfully; if I do
not, I cannot please: Would your ladyship tell me but how I shall oblige
you, and I would do it with all my heart.

Confess the truth, said she, that thou art an undone creature; hast been
in bed with thy master; and art sorry for it, and for the mischief thou
hast occasioned between him and me; and then I'll pity thee, and persuade
him to pack thee off, with a hundred or two of guineas; and some honest
farmer may take pity of thee, and patch up thy shame, for the sake of the
money; and if nobody will have thee, thou must vow penitence, and be as
humble as I once thought thee.

I was quite sick at heart, at all this passionate extravagance, and to be
hindered from being where was the desire of my soul, and afraid too of
incurring my dear master's displeasure; and, as I sat, I saw it was no
hard matter to get out of the window into the front yard, the parlour
being even with the yard, and so have a fair run for it; and after I had
seen my lady at the other end of the room again, in her walks, having not
pulled down the sash, when I spoke to Mrs. Jewkes, I got upon the seat,
and whipped out in a minute, and ran away as hard as I could drive, my
lady calling after me to return, and her woman at the other window: But
two of her servants appearing at her crying out, and she bidding them to
stop me, I said, Touch me at your peril, fellows!  But their lady's
commands would have prevailed on them, had not Mr. Colbrand, who, it
seems, had been kindly ordered, by Mrs. Jewkes, to be within call, when
she saw how I was treated, come up, and put on one of his deadly fierce
looks, the only time, I thought, it ever became him, and said, He would
chine the man, that was his word, who offered to touch his lady; and so
he ran alongside of me; and I heard my lady say, The creature flies like
a bird!  And, indeed, Mr. Colbrand, with his huge strides, could hardly
keep pace with me; and I never stopped, till I got to the chariot; and
Robert had got down, seeing me running at a distance, and held the door
in his hand, with the step ready down; and in I jumped, without touching
the step, saying, Drive me, drive me, as fast as you can, out of my
lady's reach!  And he mounted; and Colbrand said, Don't be frightened,
madam; nobody shall hurt you.--And shut the door, and away Robert drove;
but I was quite out of breath, and did not recover it, and my fright, all
the way.
