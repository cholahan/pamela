transcription: 'Pamela Censured: In a Letter to the Editor: Shewing That under the
  Specious Pretence of Cultivating the Principles of Virtue in the Minds of the Youth
  of both Sexes, the most artful and alluring amorous ideas are convey''d. And that,
  instead of being diverted of all Images that tend to inflame, the Letters abound
  with Incidents, which must necessarily raise, in the unwary Youth that read them,
  Emotions far distant from the Principles of Virtue. Exemplified in many Quotations,
  with a Critical Review, and Remarks upon the Whole. '
